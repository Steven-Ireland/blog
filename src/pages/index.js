        <h1>Hello There!</h1>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        I'm Steven Ireland, a lifelong Software Engineer most recently working as a Staff Engineer at Wayfair. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my day job I define high level system architecture, facilitate tough conversations and drive organizational alignment,
        and partner closely with product managers to create, shape, and deliver new platform features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I hack on a slew of projects including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A tiny general-purpose load testing tool built in Go <a href={GH_SPAM}><Link size={12}/></a></li>
        <li>A Reinforcement Learning based Unity Game where fantastical creatures learn to walk <a href={GH_IMPROVEMENTML}><Link size={12}/></a></li>
        <li>A Next-Generation character sheet application for tabletop games built with React, Redux, and Node.js <a href={GH_KRAKENSHEET}><Link size={12}/></a></li>
        <li>A yet-unreleased GraphQL-first Content Management Platform, with Next.js and Apollo Server</li>
        <li>And this website you're reading right now! <a href={GH_BLOG}><Link size={12}/></a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you're working on an interesting, tough, or ambiguous problem and need some help, feel free to reach out and 
        say hello. 
      </p>
